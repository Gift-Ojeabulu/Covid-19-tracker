## ‚úÖ MOTIVATION
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.As the virus that causes COVID-19 began to spread from person to person in communities (community transmission),Medical scientists needed to track the disease and try to slow its spread. To do so, The need for me to build a real-time Disease tracker for Covid-19 as a Data Scientist came in thought. Having a case definition helps to make sure cases are counted the same way everywhere. COVID-19 became a nationally notifiable disease, meaning that health departments are required to report cases of COVID-19. Medical Scientists can use chart abstractions to learn who is more likely to become severely ill, what medical care patients have received, and if patients have recovered.


## ‚úÖ What does it do? 
It shows Live cases of people with Coronavirus, cases of recovery, and Death Cases for different Countries.


## ‚úÖ Features
1. Real-time Cases of Countries Covid-19 cases(Ascending order)This part Update Every 10 Minutes.
2. Line Graph (Time Series Analysis)trend for Coronavirus worldwide cases.
3. Map Representation of Covid 19 Cases in different countries.

# What I Learned
<ul>
    <li> Using react and fetch calls to dynamically update UI.</li>
    <li> Reinforced knowledge of API integration. </li>
    <li> Leaflet.js / Chart.js libraries were used to create the interactive map and  
    responsive line graph components </li>
    <li> CSS and Material-UI libraries were used to design animations and web layout. </li>
    <li> Deployment with Firebase. </li>
</ul>




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
